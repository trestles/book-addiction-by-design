# 6. Perfect Contigency 
- "Flow provides an escape from the chaos of the quotidian," he wrote. p166
- Repeat machine gamblers, by contrast, experience a flow that is depleting, entrapping, and associated with a loss of autonomy. What accounts for this critical difference? p167
- While individuals inclined toward self-actualization engage in a positve, nonaddicting sort of flow he terms "escape forward", transcending the constraints of their reality by creating new realities, those inclined to shrink from the world engage in a negative sort of flow that or "escape backward", dulling their experience of reality through the repetition of behaviors that seldom lead to empowering affective states or open new possibilities. p167
- he neither elaborates on the profit motives behind the design of user flow nor reflects on how these motives might lead to products and services whose configuration risks drawing users' escape motivation in a "backward" direction, such that they lose themselves without self-actualizing gain. p167
## Beyond Entertainment
- a considerable degree of contradiction arises between what they say and the aspects of their design to which players appear most drawn. p168
- Gardner Grout confidently stated the same at the start of his interview: "Entertainment is what people want." p168
- This intolerance for downtime is especially true of "the really serious, hardcore video poker players" p168
- "Gambling is not a movie", echoed a casino operator in the course of a G2E panel, "it's about continuing to play." p169
- Casino managers "get more requests of *Can you turn that off?* than *Can you turn that on?*" an IGT representative remarked with some disappointment. More often than not, the features and effects intended to "entertain" are precisely the ones players would wish fade into te background as their sessions intensify. p169
- "Sensory Overload" p169
- "*We're not in the entertainment business; this is still gambling." p170
## Perfect Contigency p171
- "but by uninterrupted flow, immersion, and self-erasure." p171
- "My eyes feel like they're lining up the bars on the screen - I see them turning, and then stop, *like they are under my influence,*" said Lola of machines' reels. p171
- a psychologist of gambling has written, "playing in tune with the machine." p171
- Gordon Calleja writes in his study of online digital games, resulting in "a loss of the sense of self." p171
- blurring boundaries between players and the game. p172
- Autistic children are an exception; they remain distressed when an exogenous entity does something that demonstrates vitality of its own, and they are especially intolerant of social contingency, or the unpredicatability of another's perspective or intentions. p172
- masking disjunctive events of chance with a steady blur of small wins p173
- "I'm always hypnotized into being that machine" p173
- Designers, he elaborated in 2008, are in the business of "auto-magically making something happen by some inbound-outbound channel" p174
- Don Ihde calls the "alterity relation" or the sense of a tehcnological object's distinctness from oneself. p174
- "The machine is perfected along a bodily vector, molded to the perceptions and actions of humans," Ihde writes of technologies desgined to promote a sense of embodiment. p174
- "just playing the game" p175
- players do not act on the game, but become the game. The moment when this happens is the moment when gamblers enter the zone - a state in which alterity and agency recede. p175
## Autoplay 
- Autoplay, when entails a forfeiture of individual agency nearly from the get-go, provides an object lesson on how machine gambling can continue to compel players even as the degree of participation shrinks to nil. p176
- The contradiction present in designers' accounts of video poker corresponds to two opposing views of the local, repeat player: she is at once savvy expert who chooses video poker because she demands the highest degree of challenge and autonomy in play, and a player who gambles in a manner that is driven and passive, without aim except for its own continuance. p177
- features that initially drew them stop mattering; operational flow overrules agentic gratification p177
- Adams confirms, "which is why you see so many of the late generation video poker degenerates switching to video keno, because there's really not much to the game, *it's automatic*." p178
## Conclusion p178
- "Machines," she wrote with guarded optimism, "can be prosthetic devices, intimate components, or friendly selves." p179
- a path toward self-liquidation rather than the "self-actualization" that Csikszentmihalyi describes as the ideal outcome of flow. p179
- rather, it is an entrapping and ultimately annihilating encounter. p179
- drained of energy, resources, and vitality p179
- "My body was there, outside the machine." p179
- "Two [gamblers] have carpal tunnel--about 15 degrees of motion in their right playing arm--because of excessive  video poker play." p180
- clues to role this technology plays in facilitating, formatting, and amplifying that excess. p180
