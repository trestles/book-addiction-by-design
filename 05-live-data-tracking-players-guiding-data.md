  - The technology works by transforming massive amounts of player tracking information into colorful heat maps that represent the collective behavior of patrons in and over time [see fig 5.3]. p149
  - When rendered in visual form, the information becomes what technicians call 'actionable intelligence', organized to facilitate insights into the financial implications of slot floor reconfigurations or new marketing promotions. p149
  - She pulled up a heat-map titled 'Time Played - Females' , picturing data for women players on one casino slot floor over a twenty-four hour period. p149
  - every evening at approximately the same time, female patrons under thirty years of age were moving from one side of a popular bank of slot machines to the other (or leaving altogether), when men over fifty were taking their original seats. p151
  - "Lets say wen want to see the profitability of females fifty-five and older. *What are these ladies? Where do they live? How can we target them better?*" p151
## Touch Points: Relationship Management p152
  - Most casinos, Compudigm boasts, experience nearly 20 percent additional revenue within eight months of using its sofware; those that install a data warehouse directly on their premises are 'armed with up-to-minute information', able thus to cope with 'atomic level data across the enterprise in real time'. p151
  - "Interactivity," notes Andejevic, "is not necessarily a two-way street; more often than not, it amounts to the offer of convenience in exchange for, willing or unwitting submission to increasingly detailed forms of information gathering'" p153
  - when a player activates the machine without using a player card, the camera "captures the players image and stores it along with their game play", creating a "John Doe" file p153
  - Using statistical modeling, casinoes "tier" players based on different parameters, assigning each a "customer value" or "theoretical player value" - a value, that is, based on the theoretical revenue they are likely to generate. On a panel called "Patron Rating: The New Definition of Customer Value", one specialist shared his system for gauging patron worth, recommending that casinos give each customer a "recency score" (how recently he was visited), a "frequency score" (how often he visits), and a "monetary score" (how much he spends), and then create a personalized marketing algorithm out of these variables. p153
  - player-centric bonusing p154
  - Some have raised the question of whether it is ethical to reward players who are losing to keep them playing longer, pointing out that it is illegal to adjust a game's mathematical odds over the course of a play session. p155
  - "The staff doesn't have to make any calculation", a Bally representative told me, "the machine does it for them." p155
## Dial-Up Gambling: Flexible Control p156
  - The casino floor's game content will cease to be static, becoming "dynamically responsive" to patrons' affective and behavioral contingencies p157
  - "Throughout the day there are more locals, so we might have more video poker. At night, we might have more slots," said a slot executive at Treasure Island, where the technology was tested in 2006.
  - Machines could be virtually "reskinned" for special events like Cinco De Mayo or Chinese New Year, and in this way, a diversity of "people-dynamics and preferences [could] be accomodated." p158
  - how to ensure their acceptance of the new technology? p159
  - The player can now better tell you how to market to him. *He has complete control*. p159
  - of statistical norms, turning gambling machines into personalized reward devices. p160
  - The Paradox of Choice, Why More Is Less p161 ... the more choices you give a person, the less likely they are to pick one that satisfies them, so you have to really help them make those decisions. p161
  - A company called Talo Nevada, headed by the man often credited with inventing player tracking systems for slot machines, has also developed a way for slot machines to match gamblers' desired pace of play. p162
  - Functioning like a fully digital version of the Luck Ambassadors system described earlier, the software allows casinos to "have a conversation with the customer right at the point of decision," said an industry executive, "and really start to influence thier behaviors at the game." p162
  - Like casino interiors, machine hardware, and game software, tracking and marketing systems are designed to respond player experience as a way to *shape* that experience. p163
## Conclusion p163
  - Taking player-centrism to a new level, these portable devices function as a kind of wearable game technology, accompanying players through physical space. p163
  - Knowing the exact position of customers in a property would allow for "location sensitive mobile marketing" in which those heading toward a certain gambling area could be prompted with coupons encouraging them to bet there. p163
  - The networked infrastructure of contempoarary casinos typifies the kind of power that animates "control societies" as Deluze described them in 1990, writing just as digital information and communication technologies - on which the consumer tracking and marketing techniques described in this chapter are based - were coming onto the scene of everday life. p164
  - As in control societies, an invisible web of communicating information technologies works not to "discipline and punish" but to incite and reward. p164
  - As this chapter has shown, the industry's relentless quest to acquire and mobilize this "profuseness of data" becomes yet another register on which asymmetric collusion between the gambling industry and gamblers plays out. In an ever-more refined recursive loop, tracked players contribute to the making of machines, spaces, and services that fit them better, through their own "player-instigated action", to use  a common industry term. The gambler's affect and behavior at once condition and are conditioned by the system. p165
  - "My eyes feel like they're lining up the bars on the screen - I see them turning, and then stop, *like they are under my influence," said Lola of machines' reels. p171
