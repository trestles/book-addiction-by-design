  - The recent wave of "communal gambling" in which players may compete against others at a bank of machines while interacting only with their own gaming terminal, likewise reflects an attempt to draw younger consumers to the atomized activity of machine gambling by combinint it with with screen-based formats more familiar to them. p306

  - We can understand its particular rationalization of the aleatory domain as a variation on "the taming of chance" that Ian Hacking detected in the rise of statistical calculative thinking in the nineteenth century, a variation we might term "the gaming of chance" - a form of rationalization that proceeds *through* rather than *against* contingency, play, and affect. p307
- In the conjuncture of experiments in self-modulation (gamblers) and experiments in profitable behavioral engineering (the gambling industry), 
each partner comes to the table - or the machine, as it were - with very different stakes. Gambling addicts play machines to suspend themselves in a state of equilibrated affect rather than to maximize monetary payoff in the climax of a win; they recalibrate their play in response to the feedback of game outcomes, adjusting their pace and wagering intensity upon direction of any disequilibrium that disrupts the "machine zone" and its effective continuity. The architects, managers, and technicians of the gambling industry work to facilitate this zone and at the same time devise game schedules and marketing systems that subtly and continuously introduce disequilibrium into the gambler-machine exchange, ratcheting up its intensity and duration - or "upping the ante", in gambling parlance. To compensate for this disequilibrium and sustain the plateau-state of the zone, gambling addicts must make ever-escalating investments in machines. These investments do more than than sustain the interior state of the zone; they also sustain the exterior assemblage of technologies, design practices, regulatory policies, and political-economic values that configure the human-machine relationship in which players become caught. p308
