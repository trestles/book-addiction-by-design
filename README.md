#### 3 Programming Chance: The Calculation of Enchantment p76
- at the point of play, which always occurs *in time*, it renders the chance ever more insrutable and enchanting. p77
- In the early twentieth century, the sociologist Max Weber prposed that "man had chased [the gods] away and had rationalized and made calculable and predictatble what in an earlier age had seemed governed by chance." p77
- They are vehicles of disenchantment in the sense that they are "complex calculative devices that operate to redistribute gamblers' stakes in a very precise, calibrated and 'scientific' way", allowing their owners to leverage chance for profit and accurately calculate likely long-term gains. p77
- They are by no means divested of "mysterious, incalculable forces" but rather abundantly invested with them. p77
- "One need no longer have recourse to magical means in order to implore the spirits," Weber himself noted. "Technical means and calculations perform the service." p78
- Purposive obfuscation, his comment suggests, is key to the seductive appeal of gambling machines. p78
- Mechanical to Digital: Engineering the "Really New God" p78
- Figure 3.1 Top: Slot machine assembly line at International Gaming Technology's production facilities in Reno, Nevada; Bottom: Inside view of a three-reel slot machine 2009 p79
- establishments paid wins in drinks, cigars, or cash p80
- In jurisdictions where they were illegal, gambling devices were often disguised as gum vending machines, featuring fruit symbols (cherries, lemons, oranges, and so forth) on their reels, and offering prizes that could be redeemed for cash p81
- By the 1960s slot machines were outlawed everywhere butin Nevada and on military bases. p81
- Split p81
- "animated effects which appear to float in front of the reels" during bonus rounds. p83
- Paradoxically, advances in digital technology enable gambling machines to better pose as analog devices, communicating a physical functionality and degree of user control that no longer exist. p83
- the Really New God p84
- The degree of fascination that a given machine holds for its users, she argues, is directly related to the degree of unpredictability and aliveness that it conveys. p85
- Lightening the Odds: Virtual Reel Mapping p86
- a video display of simulated reels p87
- This unprecendented mathematical flexibility endowed gambling machines with a hitherto elusive "volatility" (or potential for dramatic wins), redoubling their market appeal. p87
- For the first time, it became possible to alter a game's probabilities not by reconfiguring its hardware but by reconfiguring its software p89
- Figure 3.2a Educational illustration of virtual reel mapping for a machine containing 32 virtual stops and 22 actual stops. p88
- which appear far more weighted in their favor than they are (often carrying four jackpot symbols as in figure 3.2a) p89
- Figure 3.2b Diagrammatic representation of a virtual reel. p89
- Telnaes's patent, as quoted above, foregrounds the invention's power to mislead, or to "present greater chances of payoff than it actually has." p90

- virtual reel mapping p91
- By 1997, more than 80 percent of spinning reel slot machines used the algorithm. p91
- Reconfiguring Loss: Near Misses p92
- near wins p92
- "Almost hitting the jackpot," noted the behaviorist psychologist B. F. Skinner in 193, "increases the probability that the individual will play the machine, although this reinforcer costs the owner of the device nothing." p93

#### 5 Live Data: Tracking Players, Guiding Play p137
- From Intuition to Analysis p141
  - Figure 5.1 Advertisement by International Gaming Technology p140
- The Rise of Player Tracking p144
- Behavioral Analytics: Actionable Intelligence p147
  - "The technology works by transforming massive amounts of player tracking information into colorful heat maps that represent the collective behavior of patrons in and over time [see fig 5.3]." p149
  - "When rendered in visual form, the information becomes what technicians call 'actionable intelligence', organized to facilitate insights into the financial implications of slot floor reconfigurations or new marketing promotions." p149
  - "She pulled up a heat-map titled 'Time Played - Females' , picturing data for women players on one casino slot floor over a twenty-four hour period." p149
  - "every evening at approximately the same time, female patrons under thirty years of age were moving from one side of a popular bank of slot machines to the other (or leaving altogether), when men over fifty were taking their original seats." p151
  - "Lets say wen want to see the profitability of females fifty-five and older. *What are these ladies? Where do they live? How can we target them better?*" p151
  - "Most casinos, Compudigm boasts, experience nearly 20 percent additional revenue within eight months of using its sofware; those that install a data warehouse directly on their premises are 'armed with up-to-minute information', able thus to cope with 'atomic level data across the enterprise in real time'". p151
  - "it amounts to the offer of convenience in exchange for, willing or unwitting submission to increasingly detailed forms of information gathering'" p153
  - "when a player activates the machine without using a player card, the camera 'captures the players image and stores it along with their game play', creating a 'John Doe' file" p153
  - "Using statistical modeling, casinoes 'tier' players based on different parameters, assigning each a 'customer value' or 'theoretical player value' - value, that is, based on the theoretical revenue they are likely to generate. On a panel called 'Patron Rating: The New Definition of Customer Value', one specialist shared his system for gauging patron worth, recommending that casinos give each customer a 'recency score' (how recently he was visited), a 'frequency score' (how often he visits), and a 'monetary score' (how much he spends), and then create a personalized marketing algorithm out of these variables." p153
  - "player-centric bonusing" p154
  - "Some have raised the question of whether it is ethical to reward players who are losing to keep them playing longer, pointing out that it is illegal to adjust a game's mathematical odds over the course of a play session." p155
  - "The staff doesn't have to make any calculation", a Bally representative told me, "the machine does it for them." p155
  - "The casino floor's game content will cease to be static, becoming 'dynamically responsive' to patrons' affective and behavioral contingencies' p157
  - "Machines could be virtually 'reskinned' for special events like Cinco De Mayo or Chinese New Year, and in this way, a diversity of 'people-dynamics and preferences [could] be accomodated.' p158
  - "how to ensure their acceptance of the new technology?" p159
  - "The player can now better tell you how to market to him. *He has complete control*." p159
  - "of statistical norms, turning gambling machines into personalized reward devices." p160
  - The Paradox of Choice, Why More Is Less p161 ... the more choices you give a person, the less likely they are to pick one that satisfies them, so you have to really help them make those decisions. p161
  - A company called Talo Nevada, headed by the man often credited with inventing player tracking systems for slot machines, has also developed a way for slot machines to match gamblers' desired pace of play. p162
  - Functioning like a fully digital version of the Luck Ambassadors system described earlier, the software allows casinos to "have a conversation with the customer right at the point of decision," said an industry executive, "and really start to influence thier behaviors at the game." p162
  - "Like casino interiors, machine hardware, and game software, tracking and marketing systems are designed to respond player experience as a way to *shape* that experience." p163
  - "Taking player-centrism to a new level, these portable devices function as a kind of wearable game technology, accompanying players through physical space." p163
  - Knowing the exact position of customers in a property would allow for "location sensitive mobile marketing" in which those heading toward a certain gambling area could be prompted with coupons encouraging them to bet there. p163
  - The networked infrastructure of contempoarary casinos typifies the kind of power that animates "control societies" as Deluze described them in 1990, writing just as digital information and communication technologies - on which the consumer tracking and marketing techniques described in this chapter are based - were coming onto the scene of everday life. p164
  - As in control societies, an invisible web of communicating information technologies works not to "discipline and punish" but to incite and reward. p164
  - As this chapter has shown, the industry's relentless quest to acquire and mobilize this "profuseness of data" becomes yet another register on which asymmetric collusion between the gambling industry and gamblers plays out. In an ever-more refined recursive loop, tracked players contribute to the making of machines, spaces, and services that fit them better, through their own "player-instigated action", to use  a common industry term. The gambler's affect and behavior at once condition and are conditioned by the system. p165
  - "My eyes feel like they're lining up the bars on the screen - I see them turning, and then stop, *like they are under my influence," said Lola of machines' reels. p171

#### 6. Perfect Contigency 
- "Flow provides an escape from the chaos of the quotidian," he wrote. p166
- Repeat machine gamblers, by contrast, experience a flow that is depleting, entrapping, and associated with a loss of autonomy. What accounts for this critical difference? p167
- While individuals inclined toward self-actualization engage in a positve, nonaddicting sort of flow he terms "escape forward", transcending the constraints of their reality by creating new realities, those inclined to shrink from the world engage in a negative sort of flow that or "escape backward", dulling their experience of reality through the repetition of behaviors that seldom lead to empowering affective states or open new possibilities. p167
- he neither elaborates on the profit motives behind the design of user flow nor reflects on how these motives might lead to products and services whose configuration risks drawing users' escape motivation in a "backward" direction, such that they lose themselves without self-actualizing gain. p167
- a considerable degree of contradiction arises between what they say and the aspects of their design to which players appear most drawn. p168
- Gardner Grout confidently stated the same at the start of his interview: "Entertainment is what people want." p168
- This intolerance for downtime is especially true of "the really serious, hardcore video poker players" p168
- "Gambling is not a movie", echoed a casino operator in the course of a G2E panel, "it's about continuing to play." p169
- Casino managers "get more requests of *Can you turn that off?* than *Can you turn that on?*" an IGT representative remarked with some disappointment. More often than not, the features and effects intended to "entertain" are precisely the ones players would wish fade into te background as their sessions intensify. p169
- "Sensory Overload" p169
- "*We're not in the entertainment business; this is still gambling." p170
- "but by uninterrupted flow, immersion, and self-erasure." p171
- "My eyes feel like they're lining up the bars on the screen - I see them turning, and then stop, *like they are under my influence,*" said Lola of machines' reels. p171
- a psychologist of gambling has written, "playing in tune with the machine." p171
- Gordon Calleja writes in his study of online digital games, resulting in "a loss of the sense of self." p171
- blurring boundaries between players and the game. p172
- Autistic children are an exception; they remain distressed when an exogenous entity does something that demonstrates vitality of its own, and they are especially intolerant of social contingency, or the unpredicatability of another's perspective or intentions. p172
- masking disjunctive events of chance with a steady blur of small wins p173
- "I'm always hypnotized into being that machine" p173
- Designers, he elaborated in 2008, are in the business of "auto-magically making something happen by some inbound-outbound channel" p174
- Don Ihde calls the "alterity relation" or the sense of a tehcnological object's distinctness from oneself. p174
- "The machine is perfected along a bodily vector, molded to the perceptions and actions of humans," Ihde writes of technologies desgined to promote a sense of embodiment. p174
- "just playing the game" p175
- players do not act on the game, but become the game. The moment when this happens is the moment when gamblers enter the zone - a state in which alterity and agency recede. p175
- Autoplay, when entails a forfeiture of individual agency nearly from the get-go, provides an object lesson on how machine gambling can continue to compel players even as the degree of participation shrinks to nil. p176
- The contradiction present in designers' accounts of video poker corresponds to two opposing views of the local, repeat player: she is at once savvy expert who chooses video poker because she demands the highest degree of challenge and autonomy in play, and a player who gambles in a manner that is driven and passive, without aim except for its own continuance. p177
- features that initially drew them stop mattering; operational flow overrules agentic gratification p177
- Adams confirms, "which is why you see so many of the late generation video poker degenerates switching to video keno, because there's really not much to the game, *it's automatic*." p178
- "Machines," she wrote with guarded optimism, "can be prosthetic devices, intimate components, or friendly selves." p179
- a path toward self-liquidation rather than the "self-actualization" that Csikszentmihalyi describes as the ideal outcome of flow. p179
- rather, it is an entrapping and ultimately annihilating encounter. p179
- drained of energy, resources, and vitality p179
- "My body was there, outside the machine." p179
- "Two [gamblers] have carpal tunnel--about 15 degrees of motion in their right playing arm--because of excessive  video poker play." p180
- clues to role this technology plays in facilitating, formatting, and amplifying that excess. p180

### Part Three: Addiction 
#### 7. Gambled Away: Liquidating Life p189
  - "At every chance, Patsy attempts to escape clock time, such that she becomes almost like a clock herself: she is 'wound'; she is 'ticked off' as time ticks by during her wait for a jackpot payoff; when she returns to work, resentful coworkers look pointedly at the clock" p207
#### 8. Overdrive: Chasing Loss, Playing to Extinction p210
  - "After that, there were no more classes, no more degrees to get; I was done with my education." p221
  - "I could see like a domino effect, that I had crossed the line and was throwing away ten years of full time education. I devastated myself emotionally, physically, financially, psychologically." p221
  - "I felt like I *almost controlled that fact*" p221
  - the machine zone p227
  - The pervasiveness of this theme in gamblers' narratives suggests the possibility of a link between their relationship to actual death and their relationship to the deathly state of the zone. p227
  - underlying preoccupation with mortality that runs through gambling behavior more generally. p227

### Part Four: Adjustment 
#### 9. Balancing Acts: The Double Bind of Therapeutics p239
  - "Participants in GA meetings frequently expand the typical self-identification of 'compulsive gambler' to 'compulsive person' or, even more expansively, 'compulsive everything'" p244

  - "In some respects, this harkens back to the first quarter of the twentieth century, when slot machines were routinely seized and taken to Halls of Justice to await court orders for their destruction, whereupon they were publicly smashed or dumped amass in waterways." p258
  - "In such a climate, prohibition and its perfomative rituals of denunciation have given way to harm minimization." p258
  - "requiring video slots to 'balance their reels' so that all contain the same symbols, in accordance with player intuition" p272
