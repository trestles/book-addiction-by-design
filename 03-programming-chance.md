#### 3 Programming Chance: The Calculation of Enchantment p76
- at the point of play, which always occurs *in time*, it renders the chance ever more insrutable and enchanting. p77
- In the early twentieth century, the sociologist Max Weber prposed that "man had chased [the gods] away and had rationalized and made calculable and predictatble what in an earlier age had seemed governed by chance." p77
- They are vehicles of disenchantment in the sense that they are "complex calculative devices that operate to redistribute gamblers' stakes in a very precise, calibrated and 'scientific' way", allowing their owners to leverage chance for profit and accurately calculate likely long-term gains. p77
- They are by no means divested of "mysterious, incalculable forces" but rather abundantly invested with them. p77
- "One need no longer have recourse to magical means in order to implore the spirits," Weber himself noted. "Technical means and calculations perform the service." p78
- Purposive obfuscation, his comment suggests, is key to the seductive appeal of gambling machines. p78

- establishments paid wins in drinks, cigars, or cash p80
- In jurisdictions where they were illegal, gambling devices were often disguised as gum vending machines, featuring fruit symbols (cherries, lemons, oranges, and so forth) on their reels, and offering prizes that could be redeemed for cash p81
- By the 1960s slot machines were outlawed everywhere butin Nevada and on military bases. p81

- "animated effects which appear to float in front of the reels" during bonus rounds. p83
- Paradoxically, advances in digital technology enable gambling machines to better pose as analog devices, communicating a physical functionality and degree of user control that no longer exist. p83
- the Really New God p84
- The degree of fascination that a given machine holds for its users, she argues, is directly related to the degree of unpredictability and aliveness that it conveys. p85
- Lightening the Odds: Virtual Reel Mapping p86
- a video display of simulated reels p87
- This unprecendented mathematical flexibility endowed gambling machines with a hitherto elusive "volatility" (or potential for dramatic wins), redoubling their market appeal. p87
- For the first time, it became possible to alter a game's probabilities not by reconfiguring its hardware but by reconfiguring its software p89
- Figure 3.2a Educational illustration of virtual reel mapping for a machine containing 32 virtual stops and 22 actual stops. p88
- which appear far more weighted in their favor than they are (often carrying four jackpot symbols as in figure 3.2a) p89
- Figure 3.2b Diagrammatic representation of a virtual reel. p89
- Telnaes's patent, as quoted above, foregrounds the invention's power to mislead, or to "present greater chances of payoff than it actually has." p90

- By 1997, more than 80 percent of spinning reel slot machines used the algorithm. p91
- Reconfiguring Loss: Near Misses p92
- near wins p92
- "Almost hitting the jackpot," noted the behaviorist psychologist B. F. Skinner in 193, "increases the probability that the individual will play the machine, although this reinforcer costs the owner of the device nothing." p93
